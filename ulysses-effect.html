    <h2>Effectiveness of the Ban on James Joyce's "Ulysses"</h2>
    <p>The ban on "Ulysses" by James Joyce took place shortly after its initial publication in 1922.</p>
    <p>The ban was most effective in countries with strict censorship laws, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, where legal battles over the book's obscenity led to its prohibition and limited distribution.</p>
    <p>However, despite the efforts to suppress it, "Ulysses" continued to be circulated and read, especially in literary circles and underground communities.</p>
    <p>Over time, the ban's effectiveness waned as societal attitudes towards censorship and literature evolved, and "Ulysses" became recognized as a masterpiece of modernist literature.</p>
