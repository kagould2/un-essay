    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Throughout this exploration, this project has delved into the historical significance and impact of various banned books, spanning different centuries and cultural contexts. From Copernicus' "De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium" to Joyce's "Ulysses," each book has contributed to the advancement of human knowledge and challenged established beliefs.</p>
    <p>Over the centuries, the church has sought universal book banning to maintain doctrinal purity and preserve its authority over religious teachings, fearing that dissenting or controversial ideas could undermine its power and influence. Additionally, by controlling access to certain texts, the church aims to regulate public discourse and ensure adherence to its beliefs and teachings among its followers.</p>
    <p>Thank you for participating in this journey of human knowledge and exploring the ways in which it can be restricted.</p>
