    <h2>Reason for Banning "Discorsi e Dimostrazioni Matematiche"</h2>
    <p>Galileo Galilei's "Discorsi e Dimostrazioni Matematiche" was banned by the Catholic Church primarily due to its support for the heliocentric model of the solar system, which contradicted the geocentric model endorsed by the Church.</p>
    <p>In this work, Galileo presented evidence from his astronomical observations and mathematical calculations to argue that the Earth revolved around the Sun, challenging the Aristotelian and Ptolemaic views that placed Earth at the center of the universe.</p>
    <p>The Church viewed Galileo's heliocentric ideas as heretical and contrary to the teachings of scripture, particularly passages in the Bible that were interpreted as supporting a geocentric cosmology.</p>
    <p>As a result, "Discorsi e Dimostrazioni Matematiche" was placed on the Index of Prohibited Books by the Catholic Church in 1632, and Galileo was eventually tried and convicted by the Inquisition for promoting heliocentrism.</p>
