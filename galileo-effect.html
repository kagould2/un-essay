    <h2>Effectiveness of the Ban on "Discorsi e Dimostrazioni Matematiche"</h2>
    <p>The ban on Galileo Galilei's "Discorsi e Dimostrazioni Matematiche" was implemented by the Catholic Church shortly after its publication in 1632.</p>
    <p>Initially, the ban was effective in suppressing the dissemination of Galileo's ideas, particularly among scholars and within academic institutions under the influence of the Church.</p>
    <p>However, despite the efforts to suppress it, the book continued to circulate clandestinely, and its ideas gradually gained acceptance among intellectuals and scientists in subsequent centuries.</p>
    <p>By the 19th century, the effectiveness of the ban had diminished significantly, and the Church eventually removed "Discorsi e Dimostrazioni Matematiche" from the Index of Prohibited Books in the mid-19th century, acknowledging its scientific value.</p>
