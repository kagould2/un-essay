    <h2>Effectiveness of the Ban on "De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium"</h2>
    <p>The ban on Nicolaus Copernicus' "De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium" was implemented by the Catholic Church shortly after its publication in 1543.</p>
    <p>Initially, the ban was effective in suppressing the circulation and dissemination of Copernicus' ideas, particularly among scholars and within academic institutions under the influence of the Church.</p>
    <p>However, despite the efforts to suppress it, the book continued to circulate clandestinely, and its ideas gradually gained acceptance among intellectuals and scientists in subsequent centuries.</p>
    <p>By the 19th century, the effectiveness of the ban had diminished significantly, and the Church eventually removed "De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium" from the Index of Prohibited Books in 1835, acknowledging its scientific value.</p>
