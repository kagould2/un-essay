    <h2>Reason for Banning "De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium"</h2>
    <p>One of the primary reasons for the Catholic Church's opposition to Nicolaus Copernicus' "De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium" was its challenge to the geocentric model of the universe, which was widely accepted at the time.</p>
    <p>The heliocentric model proposed by Copernicus, with the Sun at the center of the solar system and the Earth and other planets orbiting around it, contradicted the Aristotelian and Ptolemaic views endorsed by the Church, which placed Earth at the center of the universe.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the Church viewed Copernicus' ideas as undermining the authority of scripture and the Church's interpretation of religious doctrine. The notion that Earth was not the center of the universe challenged the theological implications of human significance and the divine order of creation.</p>
    <p>As a result, "De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium" was placed on the Index of Prohibited Books by the Catholic Church, where it remained until the ban was eventually lifted in the 19th century.</p>
