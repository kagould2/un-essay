    <h2>Reason for Controversy Surrounding "On the Origin of Species"</h2>
    <p>Charles Darwin's "On the Origin of Species" was controversial because it presented a comprehensive theory of evolution through natural selection, which contradicted the prevailing religious beliefs and creationist views endorsed by the Church.</p>
    <p>At the heart of Darwin's theory was the idea that species evolve over time through a process of natural selection, driven by competition for resources and variations in heritable traits. This challenged the traditional religious account of divine creation and the fixity of species as outlined in the Bible.</p>
    <p>The Church, particularly those with strict adherence to biblical literalism, viewed Darwin's theory as incompatible with religious doctrine and a direct challenge to the authority of scripture. The concept of evolution directly contradicted the notion of special creation and the idea that all species were individually designed by a divine creator.</p>
    <p>As a result, "On the Origin of Species" faced significant opposition from religious authorities and conservative theologians, who sought to suppress its dissemination and influence within religious communities.</p>
